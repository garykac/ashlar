Notes
Better colors for map

Divide Paris into separate entries on card

Should there be auto build at end of turn?
	That doesn't cost an action

Establish Contract & Build need to be same action since there is no way to track
established contracts other than the record of the build at that site.
	Phrase as: initial build on new site costs 2 APs

Terminology: Region vs Building Site


Placing money easy, fun
Placing stone needs thinking

Place money/stone, then spend money/stone. Are they effectively the same resource?
	They need to arrive or leave at different times to feel different.

Wasting action point doesn't feel good.
	Is this a problem? Using exactly all APs is an interesting puzzle.

What about a hand with only 2 cards?
What about needing to spend all 3 cards before re-draw

Can movement be made more interesting?
	Why not always choose the shortest path?
Can there be additional texture on the map?
	Rivers?

Next test needs:
Collapse
Scoring


Why not design game with all cards?
How important is the movement on the map?

Amiens

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiens_Cathedral
"The cathedral was built almost entirely between 1220 and c. 1270, a remarkably short period of time for a Gothic cathedral, giving it an unusual unity of style."
"The Rayonnant appeared in the triforiuum and clerestory, which were begun in 1236, and in the enlarged high windows of the choir, added in the mid-1250s."
"Amiens Cathedral is the largest in France,[7] 200,000 cubic metres (260,000 cu yd), large enough to contain two cathedrals the size of Notre Dame of Paris."
"A fire destroyed the two churches and much of the town, and a Romanesque cathedral was built to replace it between 1137 and 1152."
"In 1206 Amiens received a celebrated relic, the reputed head of John the Baptist, purchased in Constantinople. This relic made Amiens a major pilgrimage destination, and gave it an important source of revenue"
"A fire destroyed the Romanesque cathedral in 1218."
"in 1220 Bishop Evrard de Fouilloy laid the first stone."
"The nave was completed in 1236, and by 1269, the upper windows of the choir were in place. At the end of the 13th century, the arms of the transept were completed, and in the beginning of the 14th century the facades and the upper towers were finished. While these works underway, the chapels between the buttresses and at the angles of the transept were added."
1218 – Romanesque cathedral destroyed by fire
1220 – First stone placed of Gothic cathedral
c. 1240 – Completion of the nave
c. 1269 – Probable completion of chevet and installation of its high windows

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauvais_Cathedral
"It has the highest Gothic choir in the world: 48.5 metres (159 ft) under vault.[4] From 1569 to 1573 the cathedral of Beauvais was, with its tower of 153 m (502 ft), the highest human construction of the world."
"Work was begun in 1225 under count-bishop Milo of Nanteuil, with funding from his family, immediately after the third in a series of fires in the old wooden-roofed basilica, which had reconsecrated its altar only three years before the fire; the choir was completed in 1272, in two campaigns, with an interval (1232–38) owing to a funding crisis provoked by a struggle with Louis IX."
"The vaulting in the interior of the choir reaches 47.5 m (156 ft) in height, far surpassing the concurrently constructed Amiens Cathedral, with its 42-metre (138 ft) nave, and making Beauvais Cathedral the tallest vault of all the Gothic Cathedrals."
"The work was interrupted in 1284 by the collapse of some of the vaulting of the recently completed choir."
"The transept was built from 1500 to 1548. In 1573, the fall of the 153 m (502 feet) central tower stopped work again."

The old Romanesque cathedral
	"a complete reconstruction was undertaken around 1120, probably under the impetus of Bishop Guillaume de Champeaux . This project was completed in about a hundred years, despite the shortage of resources caused by competition from the collegiate church of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux 5 ."

The Gothic Cathedral
	"Undertaken under the episcopate of Pierre de Hans , it was quickly marked by the stylistic advances of construction sites such as Saint-Denis and quickly adopted the rayonnant style. The rayonnant chapels and the ambulatory were added between 1280 and 1310"

Earlier Cathedrals
"In 962 the church was damaged by another fire and was reconstructed yet again. A more serious fire broke out on 7 September 1020, after which Bishop Fulbert (bishop from 1006 to 1028) decided to build a new cathedral."
"The rebuilding proceeded in phases over the next century, culminating in 1145 in a display of public enthusiasm dubbed the "Cult of the Carts""
"In 1134, another fire in the town damaged the façade and the bell tower of the cathedral."
"The stained glass in the three lancet windows over the portals dates from some time before 1145. The Royal Portal on the west façade, between the towers, the primary entrance to the cathedral, was probably finished a year or so after 1140."

Fire and reconstruction (1194–1260)
"On the night of 10 June 1194, another major fire devastated the cathedral."
"By 1220 the roof was in place. The major portions of the new cathedral, with its stained glass and sculpture, were largely finished within just twenty-five years, extraordinarily rapid for the time. The cathedral was formally re-consecrated in October 1260"

Later modifications (13th–18th centuries)
"In 1326, a new two-storey chapel, dedicated to Saint Piatus of Tournai, displaying his relics, was added to the apse."
"In 1506, lightning destroyed the north spire, which was rebuilt in the 'Flamboyant' style from 1507 to 1513"

"In 1167, a new translation of relics took place. This time, these were those of Saint Godeberthe . Here again, the aim was probably to collect funds for the construction site."
"At this time, the builders were constructing the lower parts of the transept. The latter was perhaps completed in 1183"
"In 1185, a regulation by Bishop Renaud on the role of two sergeants in the service of the church suggests that the chevet , the transept and the eastern bays of the nave were completed."

Birth of the Notre Dame Cathedral

October 12, 1160, Maurice of Sully is elected Bishop of Paris.

Parisin a context of strong population growth and economic dynamism, affirms the significance of his role in the Kingdom of France as:
– political capital of the Capetian kings including 1 Philippe (1060-1108), Louis VI the FAT (1108-1137) and Louis VII the young (1137-1180);
– economic centre with the development on the right bank of the Seine to a city of craftsmen and merchants around the market Hall.
– a place of intellectual training : international radiation the cathedral school.

Maurice of Sully is Bishop of Paris from 1160 to 1196. Since his election, he offers a theological, spiritual and pastoral response to the transformation of his diocese by the reconstruction of a Cathedral church dedicated to the Virgin Mary (Notre Dame) and consolidating the functions of the Church the Bishop, Church of the canons and Baptistery. This project is at the center ofa huge urban project :

– demolition the former Saint-etienne and building of our Lady;
-development of a Parvis intended as an intermediate space between the secular world and the world of faith: place of catechesis sculpted by teaching to the portals ;
– construction of the new-Notre-Dame Street : full path of 6 meters wide allowing easy access to the Cathedral for a large population; It will serve as a framework for the course of the centuries in large processions;
-reconstruction of the episcopal Palace and the Hôtel-Dieu.

1163

1163 is the date traditionally used for the laying of the first stone of Notre Dame in the presence of Pope Alexander III.

The new building is part of the momentum of the new art that will be called Gothic (or ogival art). Sites already preceded him in this movement:

-in 1140 with the consecration of the Abbey of Saint-Denis built by the Abbot Suger ;
-1150: Noyon;
-1153: Senlis;
-1160: Laon, sense.

The first prime contractor anonymous takes advantage of a plan double aisle and transept salient (choices that belonged to the previous St. Stephen's Cathedral), rising to four storeys supported by the forumslarge sexpartite vaults at 32 metres 50, predominance of the horizontal line, original solution for the vaulting of the rotating part of the ambulatory, alternation of batteries 'strong '. and batteries 'weak '. between the first and the second aisle.

12th - early 13th century

Four major campaigns of work marked this period under the leadership of four contractors:

– 1163-1182 : construction of the Choir and his double ambulatory. The high altar of the chorus is dedicated May 19, 1182 by Henri de Château-Marçay, papal legate, assisted by the Bishop Maurice de Sully. (1 prime contractor).

– 1182-1190 : construction of last three spans of the nave, the aisles and forums. (2nd prime contractor).

– 1190-1225 : building the Foundation of the façade and first two bays of the navefitting of the two bays to the front up to the Gallery of Kings. (3rd contractor).

– 1225-1250 : High Gallery and the two towers on the façade, modification and expansion of high windows and development of side chapels of the nave between the abutments of the flying buttresses (4th contractor).

The work of the contractors in the late 13th - early 14th century

The names of the contractors are known: Jean de Chelles, Pierre Montreuil, Pierre de Chelles, Jean Ravy, the Blue Jean

Reims
=====

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reims_Cathedral
"On 6 May 1210,[28][29] the partly Carolingian and partly Early Gothic cathedral was destroyed by fire, allegedly due to "carelessness."[16] One year to the day afterwards, archbishop Aubrey laid the first stone of the new cathedral's chevet."
"The work on the new cathedral moved with exceptional speed, because Reims was one of the first buildings to use stones and other materials of standardised sizes, so each stone did not have to be cut to measure."
" In July 1221, the chapel at the east end of the cathedral entered use.[29] In 1230, work began on the west front, indicating that the nave was nearly complete."
"In 1233, a long-running dispute between the cathedral chapter and the townsfolk (regarding issues of taxation and legal jurisdiction) boiled over into open revolt.[31] Several clerics were killed or injured during the resulting violence and the entire cathedral chapter fled the city, leaving it under an interdict (effectively banning all public worship and sacraments).[32] Work on the new cathedral was suspended for three years, only resuming in 1236 after the clergy returned to the city and the interdict was lifted following mediation by the king and the pope. Construction then continued more slowly."
"Thereafter work moved from the west to the east, with the completion of the nave; the level of the rose windows was completed between 1275 and 1280."
"The roof of the nave and upper galleries were finished in 1299."
"Unusually, the names of the cathedral's successive architects, succeededing each other until the completion of the cathedral's structural work in 1275, are known."
"Even after the structural work had been completed in 1275, a lot of work remained to be done. The Gallery of Kings on the west front, and the octagonal upper towers were not finished until the 1460s."
"During the Hundred Years' War's Reims campaign the city was under siege by the English from 1359 to 1360, but the siege failed."

Rouen

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral
"In 1145, he began constructing a tower, now called the Tower Saint-Roman, in the new Gothic style."
"A complete reconstruction of the cathedral was begun by his successor, Gautier the Magnificent. In 1185 he demolished the Romanesque nave and began building the western end of the sanctuary."
"He had completed the west front and first traverses when the work was interrupted by a major fire on Easter eve in 1200, which destroyed a large part of the town and seriously damaged the unfinished church and its furnishings."

https://www.sacred-destinations.com/france/rouen-cathedral
"Rouen Cathedral was rebuilt in 1145 by Bishop Hugues d'Amiens based on the new Gothic style he admired at Saint-Denis Basilica in Paris. After devastating fire in 1200 destroyed all but the nave arcades, the Saint-Romain tower and the left portal, reconstruction began immediately. The choir and remainder of the cathedral were built in the more mature Gothic style of the 13th century, completed around 1250."

Senlis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senlis_Cathedral
"The construction of Notre-Dame de Senlis was started around 1151 on the site of older sanctuaries, under the impulse of Bishop Pierre (1134-1151)."
"Construction began simultaneously at both the east and west ends of the building. In 1160, the central portal of the western façade was already done. In 1167, the cathedral already had its choir and its western façade. In 1175 the nave was connected to the choir. Around 1180, the vaulted cathedral was almost completed except for the transepts. However, it was consecrated on 16 June 1191 by the Archbishop of Reims Guillaume of the White Hands. Its construction lasted about 40 years; but it was still lacking its transepts."



====
Sens
====

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sens_Cathedral
"Sens was the first cathedral to be built in the Gothic architectural style (the Basilica of Saint Denis, the other pioneer Gothic building built at about the same time, was an Abbey, not a cathedral)."
"The choir was begun between 1135 and 1140, shortly before Notre Dame de Paris. The sanctuary was consecrated in 1164, but work continued until 1176."
"In 1128 the new bishop received a series of letters from Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, founder of the Cistercian order, urging him as an archbishop to live a less luxurious and more austere life, advice which the new archbishop followed, as he amassed the funds and resources needed for his cathedral."
"Construction of the new cathedral began between 1130 and 1135.[7] The vaulting over the nave and choir was revolutionary, composed of square six-part rib vaults, which distributed the weight downward to alternating columns and piers between the bays. These vaults had been used experimentally in one portion of Durham Cathedral in England and at Saint Denis Basilica near Paris, but Sens was the first cathedral to use them throughout the structure."

"Construction probably began in 1263."
"The choir and transept were erected quickly between 1264 and 1266."
"Visitors to the church on 25 May 1266, the saint's feast day, were granted an indulgence of one year and forty days."
"The Abbey of Notre Dame aux Nonnains had great power and privileges in Troyes. A collegiate church that would be outside its jurisdiction and directly under the Holy See was a serious threat. In 1266, when the date on which Saint-Urbain would be consecrated had already been decided, the abbess Ode de Pougy sent a gang to the site that destroyed as much as possible. The doors were broken off, the high altar and capitals broken, the columns vandalized and the carpenters' tools and material confiscated. New doors were installed, which were also broken and removed soon after. A few months later a fire broke out that destroyed the wooden parts of the walls and the roof."
"The church was consecrated on 1 July 1389 while still unfinished."
"The main section of the church was not finished until the 16th century, and the tower was not completed until 1630.
